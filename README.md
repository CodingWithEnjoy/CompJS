<h2>It's CompJS</h2>
<p>This is a small library that can be effective in shortening the size of your html codes by adding it to your projects</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>Please add this code to the end of your html code first</p>
```
<script>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yesvarg/compjs@main/compjs.js</script>
```
<p>Then everything is ready for coding! From now on, you can only use the "define" tag and enter the code you want to use as a component multiple times.</p>
